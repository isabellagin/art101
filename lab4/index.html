			<h1>Lab 4- Pseudocoding & Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest issue in this lab was understanding how to add in the comments code </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was interesting and did not arise many challenges for me. My partner Lily helped me a lot and I think this was a good result. </p>

					<pre><code>
		Task 1. Pseudocode an everyday Task
			//Wash hair thoroughly with shampoo and conditioner, rinse
			//Towel dry hair
			//Apply heat protectant to hair and comb through
			//Using a blow dryer, begin drying hair at the roots around the crown of the head
			//Once the roots and crown of the head are 90% dry, switch to a roller dryer brush
			//Section the hair in three parts parallel to the crown of the head
			//Using a dryer brush, comb through the hair in a downward motion 
			//Once you reach halfway through the section of hair, twirl the hair in the dryer brush to create a curl.
			//Repeat all three sections of hair using the same technique
			//Section front pieces of the hair off from other hair
			//Using the dryer brush, brush hair down, to the right side, to the left side repeatedly
			//Continue brushing through the front pieces and then brush to the back of the head, letting the hair fall down the sides of the head
			//Finally, comb through the hair with a small drop of hair oil and style using your fingers. 

		Task 2. Pseudocode a simple computer game
		Exam Counter
		1. Obtain Exams from students
		2. Print answer sheet


		Task 3. Turn Pseudocode into comments
		Exam Counter
		// initalize pass to zero 
		// initalize fail to zero 
		// initalize students to one
		// while students counter is less than or equal to ten
		  // input the next exam results 
		  // if the students passed 
			// add one to passes counter 
		  // else 
			// add ones to fails counter
		// add one to student counter 
		// print the number of passes
		// print the number of fails
